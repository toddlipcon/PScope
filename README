I'm putting this on github since I've had a request to update it to
be compatible with the latest OSX, but no longer have any Mac
environment on which to do so. Hopefully someone else will pick it
up and update it!

I wrote this about 6 years ago, and haven't touched it since, so
please excuse the total crappiness of some of the code within.

The license is unknown - looking at the code, it looks like I started
with some AudioUnit example and then hacked from there. Looking at
the license headers from the example code, it appears to be BSD-ish.
